# Testing of Postcodes API

### Description
This code is used for tests against the postcodes api using ruby and httparty. Each part of the array was individually tested against the object type using rspec and each has passed. This is to demonstrate a working understanding how data is retrieved and tested against an API. 

### Languages used
* Ruby

### How to download
1. Clone the Git repo
2. Install httparty gem
2. Open the files and run rspec 
3. You will now see the tests that pass!

### Challenges 
1. Difficulty to run tests with the mutiple postcodes 

### Learning points
1. This helped develop my understanding of dealing with an API and how to handle and retrieve date
